Guided SQL Data Exploration Project:
- Here is a list of notes and steps I took along the way as I worked through this project

- Go to "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" and download the data set
- Export the data set to google docs to get access to google sheets for formatting
- Google sheets is either unable or unwilling (in a timely manner) so I will begin by processing the data into the correct format using python
- Filter Dataset down to the following relevant columns:
		- first 26 columns + popoulation save as covid_deaths
		- remove columns 5 to 26 and population save as covid_vaccinations
- Add data to BigQuery Sandbox
- Verify necessary columns from covid_deaths table exist (Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population)
- Get death percentage by country (Show Unitied states)
- Get % of confirmed cases in population by country (show Unitied States)
- Show Countries with the highest % infection rates
- Output Death Rates for each country
- Start looking at the world as a whole per day (to get whole remove date column)
	- Get global death percentage
	- use SUM(new_cases) to get the total across the world of covid infections
	- repeat for new_deaths to get total deaths 
	- incorrect data type for new_deaths cast as an int
- Join the vaccination table with the death table to start getting vaccination data
- To get the total vaccinations for the each country use the formula:  sum(new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY Location)
- Use CTE to use total_vax to in order to get vaccinations vs population
- create a view
- BigQuery is asking for billing information to export the view so I will not be doing that.
