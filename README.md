# Here is a guided portfolio project in SQL
 This project explores global covid data in SQL using BigQuery Sandbox (The video I followed while doing this is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM). <br />
 <br />
  The data can be found in the "data" directory. <br />
 Covid_Data_Process.ipynb creates usable data sets for use in BigQuery <br />
 Covid_Exploration.sql contains all the queries I ran <br />
 Portfolio_Project_1_Notes.txt contains notes I made while doing this project <br />
